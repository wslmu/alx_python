How to use lists as stacks and queues
What are list comprehensions and how to use them
What are tuples and how to use them
When to use tuples versus lists
What is a sequence

Requirements
Python Scripts
Recommended editor: Visual studio code
All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
All your files should end with a new line
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.*)
The length of your files will be tested using wc
Quiz questions

Tasks
0. Can you C me now?
mandatory
Write a function that removes all characters c and C from a string.

Prototype: def no_c(my_string):
The function should return the new string
You are not allowed to import any module
You are not allowed to use str.replace()
guillaume@ubuntu:~/$ cat 0-main.py
#!/usr/bin/env python3
no_c = __import__('0-no_c').no_c

print(no_c("Holberton School"))
print(no_c("Chicago"))
print(no_c("C is fun!"))

guillaume@ubuntu:~/$ ./0-main.py
Holberton Shool
hiago
 is fun!

1. Lists of lists = Matrix
mandatory
Write a function that prints a matrix of integers.

Prototype: def print_matrix_integer(matrix=[[]]):
Format: see example
You are not allowed to import any module
You can assume that the list only contains integers
You are not allowed to cast integers into strings
You have to use str.format() to print integers
guillaume@ubuntu:~/$ cat 1-main.py
#!/usr/bin/python3
print_matrix_integer = __import__('1-print_matrix_integer').print_matrix_integer

matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]

print_matrix_integer(matrix)
print("--")
print_matrix_integer()

guillaume@ubuntu:~/$ ./1-main.py | cat -e

2. More returns!
mandatory
Write a function that returns a tuple with the length of a string and its first character.

Prototype: def multiple_returns(sentence):
If the sentence is empty, the first character should be equal to None
You are not allowed to import any module
guillaume@ubuntu:~/$ cat 2-main.py
#!/usr/bin/python3
multiple_returns = __import__('2-multiple_returns').multiple_returns

sentence = "At Holberton school, I learnt C!"
length, first = multiple_returns(sentence)
print("Length: {:d} - First character: {}".format(length, first))

guillaume@ubuntu:~/$ ./2-main.py
Length: 32 - First character: A
